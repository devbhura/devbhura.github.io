                        The report below details the process of building several controllers,
                        such as PD and PID controllers for 2-DOF systems. The 2-DOF system
                        consists of two circular plates connected by a flexible rod that acts as
                        a torsional spring, as shown below in figure 1.

                            lower plate which moves the plate <span
                            class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span>. The plate <span
                            class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> moves an angle <span
                            class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sub>1</sub></span>, which is directly
                            controlled by the controller. <span
                            class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> is also connected to

                            through a flexible rod. The motion in <span
                            class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> causes motion in <span
                            class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub>2</sub></span>. This motion is
                            captured by <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sub>2</sub></span>. The
                            objective in this report is to show various controllers for <span
                            class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span
                            class="math inline"><em>I</em><sub>2</sub></span>.

                    <h2> FeedBack Control Design </h2>

                    <p align="justify" >A controller is used to drive the system to the desired output. One
                        of the hallmarks of a controller is using a negative feedback loop.
                        Feedback controller means that the output of the system is fed in as an
                        input to the controller. Negative feedback means that this feedback is
                        subtracted from the input to give us the error. The controller is
                        designed such that it minimizes this error to drive the system to the
                        desired output. In a 2-DOF system controller, different controller
                        designs are used to control different things.

                    </p>
                    <p align="justify" >Collocated controllers are used to control the disc connected to the
                        actuator directly. It is the most effective controller. The block
                        diagram below shows how the Collocated controller is set up. It aims to
                        control <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>1</sub></span> by
                        controlling the response of the collocated plant <span

                    <h2> Design Approach </h2>
                    <p align="justify">The aim was to minimize the maximum overshoot and the settling time
                        of the response, the control effort and the steady state error. This was
                        done through PD and PID controllers, in their cascade and velocity
                        feedback architectures (block diagram shown for each individual
                        controller design). These controllers were designed using sisotool. The
                        root locus was changed to give the desired output. The figure 10 a shows
                        root locus of the PD series controlled system. To increase the design
                        space, the real zero was moved sufficiently. The closed loop poles shown
                        in solid pink are moved around to give the desired results, either to
                        reduce maximum overshoot, settling time, control effort or steady state
                        error.</p>
